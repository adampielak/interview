For ensure the Application Security and infrastructure  we need to Perform the DAST (Dynamic application security testing ) 
and SAST (Static Application Security Testing) for that we have to have Couple of tools ie. For DAST  Burpsuite And for SAST Checkmarx .
we required the license based on that I can deployed and configured the tools for as per the security requirement 

Cloud Security infra monitoring : Splunk .  When you change your configuration in Splunk Web, that change is written to a copy of the 
configuration file for that setting. Splunk software creates a copy of this configuration file (if it does not exist), writes the change to that copy, and adds it to a directory under $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/.... The directory that the new file is added to depends on a number of factors that are discussed in Configuration file directories in this manual. The most common directory is $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local, which is used in the example.

If you add a new index in Splunk Web, the software performs the following actions:
1. Checks for a copy of the file.
2. If no copy exists, the software creates a copy of indexes.conf and adds it to a directory, such as $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local.
3. Writes the change to the copy of indexes.conf.
4. Leaves the default file unchanged in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/default.

Application Security we can have to test OWASP top 10 for that we have use to ASVS Approach (Application Security Verification 
Standard )

ASVS Level :  The ASVS defines set of levels of verification, with each level increasing in depth as the verification moves up the levels.

ASVS Level 1 : Opportunistic. Considered by OWASP to be the minimum required for all applications on the web. 
CISO consider level 1 to be the minimum mandatory security required for Project to project applications.

ASVS Level 2 : is typically appropriate for applications that handle significant business¬ to¬ business transactions, implement
business critical or sensitive functions, or process other sensitive assets

ASVS Category  
1.	Architecture
2.	Authentication
3.	Session
4.	Malicious Input Handling
5.	Cryptography at Rest
6.	Error Handling
7.	Data Protection
8.	Communications Security
9.	HTTP Security
10.	Files and Resources
11.	Web services
12.	Configuration

Please find the detailed ASVS  for Application Security based on the ASVS levels we can secure the application. 

For more information kindly refer the attached ASVS App & infra Security-Sheet which is availabe on GitHub .
